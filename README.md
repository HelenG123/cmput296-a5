# webdev_projects

This is the start of something special... my web development skills.

Current Projects:
1) Blackjack (Free Gambling) Version 1
   - Main focus was on understanding JavaScript and fetch.
   - Read up of XHR (XMLHttpRequest) and compared against fetch (fetch won).
2) Blackjack Version 2
   - Same thing but with React.js and JSX!
   - Made the website wayyyy prettiet.
   - TODO: Make it so the website can adjust to different window sizes.
3A) Profile Website: Pretty
   - Challenge: Don't use div tags (not proper semantic markup).
   - TODO: 
      * Used section tags improperly to create the window tabs for each section. Fix it so it's proper semantic.
      * Update the information on the site to be professional and thorough.
3B) Profile Website: Ugly
